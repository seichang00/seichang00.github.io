abstract: The recent increase of fine dust levels has resulted in substantially harmful effects on human health. This paper proposes an easily accessible and cost-efficient dust monitoring system that retrieves fine dust levels within a local area. An Arduino-based IoT device is connected to a fine dust sensor and provides dust-level data to a mobile application in real time. The proposed system provides new mobile service opportunities such as sending immediate alerts to the service subscribers who live nearby.
